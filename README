A real-time facial emotion detection system built with Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace. The system captures live webcam footage, detects faces, classifies emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral), logs emotional trends over time, and plots emotion statistics — all in real-time!

📸 Features
🔍 Real-Time Face Detection via webcam

😊 Emotion Recognition using pre-trained DeepFace models

📁 Live Emotion Logging into a .csv file

📊 Visual Analysis of emotions over time using Matplotlib

🧠 Optional: Extendable for custom datasets, improved accuracy, and audio integration

📊 Emotion Tracking Sample
A snapshot from the generated log:

Timestamp	Emotion
2025-07-17 23:55:20	neutral
2025-07-17 23:55:21	happy
2025-07-17 23:55:22	sad

Use plot_emotions.py to generate bar graphs or emotion frequency charts.

🧪 Future Improvements
🎯 Fine-tune model accuracy for subtle emotions (e.g., fear, anger)

🧠 Train on custom datasets

🎙️ Integrate voice-based emotion detection

📊 Add live dashboard UI with real-time charts

🌐 Web-based version with Flask/Streamlit
